                    The caterpillar is the larval stage of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths). As with most common names, the application of the term is arbitrary, but generally it refers to the larvae of butterflies and moths.

                        <li>Caterpillars have long, segmented bodies with three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to five pairs of prolegs on the abdominal segments.</li>
                        <li>They have chewing mouthparts and are primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, although some species are carnivorous or detritivorous.</li>
                        <li>Caterpillars undergo several molts as they grow, shedding their exoskeletons to accommodate their increasing size.</li>
